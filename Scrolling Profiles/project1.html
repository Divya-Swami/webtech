                <h1>Swami Vivekananda</h1>
                <p>Swami Vivekananda (/ˈswɑːmi ˌvɪveɪˈkɑːnəndə/; Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɔndo] (listen); 12 January 1863 –
                    4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an Indian Hindu monk,
                    philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic
                    Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western
                    world[6][7][8] and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the
                    status of a major world religion.[9] Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament
                    of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the words, "Sisters and brothers of
                    America...," before introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He was so impactful at the Parliament
                    that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest
                    figure at the Parliament".[12] After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years,
                    Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe,
                    disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and
                    the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California),[13] both of which
                    became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West.
                    <br>

                    Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young
                    age towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk.
                    After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring
                    first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their
                    plight, he resolved to help his countrymen, and found a way to travel to the United States where he
                    was highly successful. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual
                    training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission, to provide charity,
                    social work and education.[7] Vivekananda was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform
                    movements, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.[14] He is regarded as a
                    patriotic saint, and his birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.[15][16]

                <h1>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</h1>
                <p>Studies at the University of Bombay
                    In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered Elphinstone
                    College, which was affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first
                    from his Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people
                    of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights"
                    which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A
                    public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion
                    that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family
                    friend.[31]

                    By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and
                    prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young
                    family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died
                    on 2 February 1913.[32]
                    <br>
                    Studies at Columbia University
                    In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per
                    month for three years under a scheme established by Sayajirao Gaekwad III (Gaekwad of Baroda) that
                    was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at Columbia University in New York
                    City. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at Livingston Hall with Naval Bhathena, a Parsi
                    who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and
                    other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, Ancient
                    Indian Commerce. Ambedkar was influenced by John Dewey and his work on democracy.[33]

                    In 1916, he completed his second master's thesis, National Divid

                <p>Lal Bahadur Shastri (Hindustani: [laːl bəˈɦaːdʊr ˈʃaːstri], audio speaker iconlisten (help·info), 2
                    October 1904 – 11 January 1966) was an Indian politician. He was the 2nd Prime Minister of India
                    from 1964 to 1966. He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress political party.

                    Shastri died on 11 January 1966 in Tashkent, Soviet Union from a heart attack at the age of 61. Many
                    people believed that there was a conspiracy to his death and that he was <br>
                    As prime minister, Shastri was criticized for failing to deal effectively with India’s economic
                    problems. However, he won great popularity for his firmness in dealing with neighboring Pakistan
                    when fighting broke out between the two countries in 1965 over the disputed Kashmir region. Shastri
                    died of a heart attack on January 11, 1966, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, U.S.S.R., after signing a
                    “no-war” agreement with President Mohammad Ayub Khan of Pakistan. Shastri was succeeded as prime
                    minister by Indira Gandhi, Nehru’s daughter.
