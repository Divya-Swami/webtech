            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <br>
            <p>

                Savitribai Jyotirao Phule was a prominent Indian social reformer, educationist and poet who played an
                instrumental role in women education and empowerment during the nineteenth century. Counted among few
                literate women of those times, Savitribai is credited for founding the first girl’s school in Pune in
                Bhide Wada with her husband Jyotirao Phule. She took great effort towards educating and emancipating
                child widows, campaigned against child marriage and sati pratha, and advocated for widow remarriage. A
                leading figure of Maharashtra’s social reform movement, she is considered an icon of Dalit Mang caste
                along with likes of B. R. Ambedkar and Annabhau Sathe. She campaigned against untouchability and worked
                actively in abolishing caste and gender based discrimination.</p><br>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <br>
            <p>

                Savitribai was born on January 3, 1831, in Naigaon (presently in Satara district) in British India in a
                farming family to Khandoji Neveshe Patil and Lakshmi as their eldest daughter. Girls in those days were
                married off early, so following the prevalent customs, the nine year old Savitribai was wedded to 12
                years old Jyotirao Phule in 1840. Jyotirao went on to become a thinker, writer, social activist and
                anti-caste social reformer. He is counted among the leading figures of Maharashtra’s social reform
                movement. Savitribai’s education started after her marriage. It was her husband who taught her to read
                and write after he saw her eagerness to learn and educate herself. She cleared third and fourth year
                examination from a normal school and became passionate about teaching. She took training at Ms Farar’s
                Institution in Ahmednagar. Jyotirao stood firmly by the side of Savitribai in all her social endeavours.

                Her adopted son Yashwantrao served the people of his area as a doctor. When the worldwide Third Pandemic
                of the bubonic plague badly affected the area around Nallaspora, Maharastra in 1897, the courageous
                Savitribai and Yashwantrao opened a clinic at outskirts of Pune to treat the patients infected by the
                disease. She brought the patients to the clinic where her son treated them while she took care of them.
                In course of time, she contracted the disease while serving the patients and succumbed to it on March
                10, 1897.</p>

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <br>
            <p>

                The relentless efforts of Savitribai in curbing the age-old evils of society and the rich legacy of good
                reforms left behind by her continues to inspire generations. Her reformative works have been recognised
                over the years. A memorial was created in her honour by the Pune City Corporation in 1983. India Post
                released a stamp in her honour on March 10, 1998. The University of Pune was renamed after her in 2015
                as Savitribai Phule Pune University. Search engine Google commemorated her 186th birth anniversary on
                January 3, 2017, with a Google doodle.</p>
